   - Identify potential competitive implications

Return analysis with specific citations to sections and page numbers using [SEC-ID:PAGE] format. Include both comprehensive analysis and executive summary.
```

#### Contract Clause Generation

```
Generate a [CLAUSE_TYPE] clause for a [CONTRACT_TYPE] with the following parameters:

1. Parties: [PARTY_A], [PARTY_B]
2. Governing Law: [JURISDICTION]
3. Risk Posture: [AGGRESSIVE/BALANCED/CONSERVATIVE]
4. Special Considerations: [ANY_SPECIFIC_REQUIREMENTS]

The clause should:
- Use precise, unambiguous legal language
- Follow standard structure for this clause type
- Address common pitfalls and edge cases
- Include necessary definitions or cross-references

```

   - Quantify potential financial/operational consequences where possible
   - Consider both direct and indirect effects

4. Risk Scoring and Classification:
   - Calculate risk score (probability × impact)
   - Classify each risk (Low: 1-4, Medium: 5-9, High: 10-16, Critical: 17-25)
   - Prioritize risks by score and strategic importance

5. Mitigation Recommendations:
   - Propose specific risk mitigation strategies
   - Suggest contractual provisions or operational controls
   - Reference standard clauses [C-ID] where applicable

Return assessment with visualized risk matrix, prioritized risk list, and detailed mitigation plan.
```

### Error Handling Prompts

#### Insufficient Information Response

```
When user requests cannot be fully addressed due to insufficient information, respond with:

1. Clear acknowledgment of the information gap
2. Explanation of why additional information is needed
3. Specific questions to gather the required information
4. Partial analysis based on available information (if possible)
5. Alternative approaches if the requested information cannot be provided

Never guess or make assumptions about missing critical information. Always maintain professional tone while explaining limitations.

Example structure:
"Based on the information provided, I can offer a preliminary assessment, but additional details would allow for more comprehensive analysis. Specifically, I would need to know [specific questions]. In the meantime, here's what I can determine from the available information: [partial analysis]."
```

#### Citation Not Found

```
When a relevant citation cannot be found in the knowledge base, respond with:

1. Transparent acknowledgment that specific information is not in the database
2. General information about the topic based on common legal principles
3. Clear distinction between general knowledge and specific guidance
4. Suggestion to consult other authoritative sources
5. Alternative approaches or related information that IS available in the database

Never fabricate citations or claim information exists in the database when it doesn't. Be explicit about the boundaries of available information.

Example structure:
"I don't have a specific citation for [requested information] in my knowledge base. While I can provide general information about [topic] based on common legal principles, I cannot offer specific guidance about [detailed request]. You may want to consult [suggested authoritative source]. However, I can provide information about these related aspects: [available related information with proper citations]."
```

### Conversation Examples

#### Example 1: Contract Analysis

**User**: Can you analyze the indemnification clause in our vendor agreement?

**System thought process**:
1. User wants analysis of indemnification clause
2. Need to search corpus for relevant terms and clauses
3. Will structure response with definition, analysis, and recommendations
4. Must include citations and disclaimer

**Assistant**:
```
I'll analyze the indemnification clause in your vendor agreement.

## Key Elements
The clause contains a broad indemnification obligation requiring your company to "indemnify, defend, and hold harmless" the vendor against "any and all claims" [D-123]. This language creates significant risk exposure for several reasons:

1. **Scope**: The indemnification covers "any and all claims" without limitation to claims arising from your company's negligence or breach [T-892]
2. **Defense Obligation**: Includes explicit duty to defend, which may require paying legal fees regardless of merit [C-456]
3. **No Reciprocity**: The obligation is one-sided with no corresponding vendor indemnification [C-789]

## Risk Assessment
This represents a **High Risk** provision due to:
- Unlimited liability exposure
- No negligence standard
- One-sided obligation
- No cap on indemnification amounts

## Recommendations
Consider these alternatives:
1. **Mutual Indemnification** [C-234]: Both parties indemnify each other for their own negligence
2. **Limited Indemnification** [C-567]: Add qualifiers like "to the extent caused by" and exclude consequential damages
3. **Capped Liability**: Add financial cap aligned with contract value

#### Example 2: Regulatory Research

**User**: What SEC regulations should we consider for our SaaS product's privacy disclosures?

**System thought process**:
1. User wants SEC regulatory guidance for SaaS privacy disclosures
2. Need to search for relevant SEC regulations, terms, and filings
3. Will structure response with applicable regulations and examples
4. Must include citations and disclaimer

**Assistant**:
```
# SEC Regulations for SaaS Privacy Disclosures

For SaaS companies, several SEC disclosure requirements apply to privacy practices:

## Regulation S-K Items
1. **Item 1A: Risk Factors** [T-412]
   - Must disclose material privacy and data security risks
   - Should address regulatory compliance risks (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
   - Recent enforcement emphasizes specific, not generic, disclosures [SEC-AAPL-10K-2023]

2. **Item 7: MD&A** [T-415]
   - Discuss material trends in privacy regulations affecting operations
   - Disclose privacy-related expenses and investments

3. **Item 105: Business Description** [T-418]
   - Describe how privacy practices affect business model
   - Explain data use as material to operations

## Recent SEC Guidance
The SEC's 2023 guidance emphasizes [SEC-33-11150]:
- Timely disclosure of material privacy incidents
- Board oversight of privacy risks
- Quantification of privacy regulation impacts

## Examples From Industry
- Salesforce's disclosure includes specific privacy regulatory risks [SEC-CRM-10K-2023]
- Microsoft details privacy governance structure [SEC-MSFT-10K-2023]
